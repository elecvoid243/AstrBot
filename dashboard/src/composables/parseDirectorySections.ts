//
// Recursive directory-section builder for the GitDiff sidebar's file
// list. The previous (2026-06-28) implementation grouped by top-level
// directory only, so a new tracked directory like `new_dir/` showed up
// as a single bucket even when it contained many nested files. After
// the spcode v2.21.1 git-status endpoint started returning recursive
// untracked paths (see webapi-git-status-api.md §6), the UI had no
// matching way to render the tree — this module fills that gap by
// folding each file into one section per ancestor directory.
//
// 2026-07-28 (rev): switched from a strip-as-you-recurse bucket
// pass to a fold-over-full-paths pass. The earlier design mutated
// `file.path` (stripped the ancestor prefix) so selection sets,
// stage/unstage/restore calls, and new-file lookups all received
// truncated paths the backend could not resolve. The fold keeps
// `file.path` verbatim (full repo-relative POSIX path) and records
// section membership by directory prefix instead.
//
// Pure function (no Vue, no axios) so it is unit-testable under
// `node --test` (see tests/buildDirectorySections.test.mjs).

 *               is returned.
 *   scope:      active diff scope, drives the per-section badge.

 *
 * Idempotent: same input → same output, including ids. No exceptions
