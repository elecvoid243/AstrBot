  MarkdownView — thin wrapper around markstream-vue's <MarkdownRender>.

  2026-07-13 refactor: this used to ship its own renderer
  (createMarkdownRenderer in MarkdownPipeline.ts) plus ~370 lines of
  hand-written markdown CSS. That was a full re-implementation of
  what markstream-vue already does, and it was the reason the
  DocumentManager render looked noticeably uglier than ChatUI's
  chat-message render — they were two completely independent code
  paths with the DocumentManager one missing major features
  (KaTeX, Mermaid, theme tokens, etc.).

  Now this component delegates to the same <MarkdownRender> that
  ChatUI's MarkdownMessagePart uses. The visual output is identical
  to the chat message view: same heading scale, same inline-code
  pill, same table borders, same blockquote treatment, same Shiki
  highlighter, same dark-mode behavior. The previous custom CSS
  block has been deleted; the only style that remains is a thin
  container rule so the rendered HTML has a stable box.

  Consumers (DocumentManager, ReadmeDialog) keep their existing
  prop shape (:source, :is-dark, :container-class) so no caller
  had to change.
